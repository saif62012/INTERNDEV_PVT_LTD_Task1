# INTERNDEV_PVT_LTD_Task-1
🚀 Successfully Set Up a Virtual Lab for Cybersecurity! 🔐
As part of my internship at InternDev Pvt Ltd, I had the opportunity to set up a virtual lab environment using VMware Workstation and Kali Linux to support cybersecurity research and practical exercises. This setup enables secure penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and ethical hacking practices in a controlled environment.

📌 Key Highlights of the Lab Setup
✅ Installed VMware Workstation and configured a virtual machine
✅ Installed and optimized Kali Linux for security testing
✅ Configured network settings (NAT/Bridged) for seamless connectivity
✅ Ensured proper system updates and tool availability

This fully functional lab environment allows me to explore real-world cybersecurity challenges while maintaining security best practices.
